I was from Nellore (Andhra Pradesh).I pursed my Higher Qualification in B.Tech(Bachelors of Technology) in the stream of EEE(Electrical & Electronics Engineering) in Narayana Engineering College- Nellore(524003) and My Intermediate Education was under the Stream of MPC in Narayana Junior College and My Primary Education has been in 2 schools class(1 to 5) from Anglophill school and to improve my skills from class 5 I pursed my Education in another school which was Dr.Cv.Raman E.M High School. I was very passionate about learning the Skills beyond of my stream that I was studied in my college.
                                I was very intrested to build up my skills in coding sector but unfortunatley i went to Electrical stream side .</p>
                            <p>The way of being passionate to learn coding had brought up me into Web Development and to take up the Full Stack Devlopement course(JAVA) and I had learnt this from several websites that genie towards coding had boost up me to learn from several websites. Which imporves my Skills and as it was my passion to learn coding so i can work more Efficently to build my carrer in Coding Sector. </p>
